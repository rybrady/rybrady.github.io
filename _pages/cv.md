Education
======
* B.S. in Marine Science with a minor in Chemistry, California State University, Monterey Bay, Expected 2025

Research experience
======
* Effects of sediment grain size and shell length on the burial rate of Pismo clams in the Monterey Bay.
  Coastal Ecology Lab: Olivia Beaudoin, MLML, and Dr. Alison Haupt, CSUMB
  * Project description: Led the first controlled experimental study quantifying burial rates in Tivela stultorum (Pismo clam). Examined how sediment grain size and shell length influence burial duration and depth, developing novel methods for maintaining live specimens in aquaria. Results provide insight into habitat parameters that promote restoration and persistence of local populations—currently co-authoring a peer-reviewed manuscript in collaboration with a graduate researcher at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.
Recruited, trained, and oversaw 6 volunteer undergraduate field assistants.   
  * Relevant Skills: Marine organism husbandry, aquarium systems, experimental design and implementation


* Geological habitat variability and its effect on populations of Tivela stultorum (Pismo clam) within Monterey Bay.
  Coastal Ecology Lab: Olivia Beaudoin, MLML, and Dr. Alison Haupt, CSUMB	
  * Project description: Conducted the first comprehensive survey of Tivela stultorum (Pismo clam) population dynamics in Monterey Bay since the 1960s. Investigated how sedimentary and geological habitat characteristics influence the spatial distribution, abundance, and age structure of Pismo clam populations. The findings contribute to identifying environmental conditions that support the maintenance and restoration of local populations—currently co-authoring a manuscript in collaboration with a graduate researcher from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
  * Recruited, trained, and oversaw more than 45 volunteer undergraduate field assistants.
  * Relevant Skills: Quantitative marine population ecology, sediment and habitat analysis, sediment sizing, statistical and spatial data analysis

* Growth Scaling in By-the-Wind Sailors (Velella Velella)
Dr. Salvador Jorgensen, CSUMB, and Dr. Robin Elhai, Stanford
  * Project description: Investigating growth allometry in Velella velella through field sampling of mass-stranded individuals along the central California coast. Designed and implemented morphometric measurement protocols to quantify sail-to-base scaling relationships and analyzed allometric trends using R. Currently collaborating with researchers at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station on a manuscript in preparation for peer-reviewed publication.
  * Relevant Skills: Experimental design and field sampling, morphometric and allometric analysis, scientific collaboration

* Supervised machine learning of continental and archipelago asphaltenes utilizing Wolfram Mathematica.
   Dr. Arun Sharma, CSUMB
  * Project description: Utilized Wolfram Mathematica to expand an existing molecular dataset from 255 to 1,530 structures, ensuring balanced labeling for classification analysis. Implemented and validated a machine learning classifier based on molecular topological descriptors, achieving high predictive accuracy with minimal error across both training and testing datasets. Findings were peer-reviewed and published in Results in Chemistry.
  * Relevant Skills: Data preprocessing and augmentation, Machine learning model development and validation, and literature review. 

* Surf zone monitoring of Monterey Bay Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
  Dr. Scott Hamilton, MLML
  * Project description: Conducted field surveys of surf-zone fish and algal communities within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reference sites using baited remote underwater video (BRUV) systems and beach seine sampling. Quantified species abundance and community composition to assess MPA effectiveness. Findings are intended to inform evidence-based policy and management decisions for coastal marine conservation.
  * Relevant Skills: Marine biodiversity assessment, data collection, species identification

* Developing low-impact ocean instruments to monitor juvenile sharks and rays.
  Dr. Salvador Jorgensen, CSUMB
  * Project description: Developed and implemented non-invasive tagging methodologies to monitor the movement of Myliobatis californica (bat rays) and Triakis semifasciata (leopard sharks). Designed and programmed an Arduino MKR NB 1500 system to provide real-time notifications upon biologger detachment. This work enhances ethical tracking techniques for elasmobranch research and long-term movement ecology studies.
  * Relevant Skills: Biologging, Arduino programming, sensor integration, marine vertebrate behavior, and movement ecology
